the 'BMW M3 GTR (Race) career start car' is now equal to the 'BMW M3 GTR (Race) car' in every way
the 'BMW M3 GTR (Race) career start car' is the car you drive in the prologue (career intro)

the 'BMW M3 GTR (Race) car' is the car you get when you beat razor, and it is the car razor drives

so now when they say "razor rocketed to the top of the blacklist using your car" they literally mean it!
